<div class="trans"><strong>The Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvān, and Vivasvān instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikṣvāku.</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">Herein we ﬁnd the history of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> traced from a remote time when it was delivered to the royal order of all planets, beginning from the sun planet. The kings of all planets are especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants, and therefore the royal order should understand the science of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.</div>
<div class="para">In this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasvān, the king of the sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> (5.52) it is stated:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ<br />rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ<br />yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro<br />govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi</em></div>
<div class="purp">“Let me worship,” Lord Brahmā said, “the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order.”</div>
<div class="para">The sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name Vivasvān) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of Kṛṣṇa, and Lord Kṛṣṇa originally made Vivasvān His ﬁrst disciple to understand the science of <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> The <em>Gītā</em> is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insigniﬁcant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial.</div>
<div class="para">In the <em>Mahābhārata</em> (<em>Śānti-parva</em> 348.51–52) we can trace out the history of the <em>Gītā</em> as follows:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>tretā-yugādau ca tato<br />vivasvān manave dadau<br />manuś ca loka-bhṛty-arthaṁ<br />sutāyekṣvākave dadau<br />ikṣvākuṇā ca kathito<br />vyāpya lokān avasthitaḥ</em></div>
<div class="purp">“In the beginning of the millennium known as Tretā-yuga this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvān to Manu. Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mahārāja Ikṣvāku, the king of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord Rāmacandra appeared.” Therefore, <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> existed in human society from the time of Mahārāja Ikṣvāku.</div>
<div class="para">At the present moment we have just passed through ﬁve thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dvāpara-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Tretā-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> to his disciple and son Mahārāja Ikṣvāku, the king of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu the <em>Gītā</em> was spoken by the Lord to His disciple the sun-god Vivasvān, a rough estimate is that the <em>Gītā</em> was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about ﬁve thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the <em>Gītā,</em> according to the <em>Gītā</em> itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasvān because he is also a <em>kṣatriya</em> and is the father of all <em>kṣatriyas</em> who are descendants of the sun-god, or the <em>sūrya-vaṁśa kṣatriyas.</em> Because <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is as good as the <em>Vedas,</em> being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is <em>apauruṣeya,</em> superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the <em>Gītā</em> must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the <em>Gītā</em> in their own ways, but that is not <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> as it is. Therefore, <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ikṣvāku.</div>

<div class="trans-title">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="trans"><strong>This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">It is clearly stated that the <em>Gītā</em> was especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate its value for no one’s beneﬁt and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the <em>Gītā</em> appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the <em>Gītā</em> (especially in English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, although they make a good business on the words of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of the <em>Gītā</em> in English, as it is received by the <em>paramparā</em> (disciplic succession) system, an attempt is made herewith to fulﬁll this great want. <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>&nbsp;– accepted as it is&nbsp;– is a great boon to humanity; but if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of time.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">There are two classes of men, namely the devotee and the demon. The Lord selected Arjuna as the recipient of this great science owing to his being a devotee of the Lord, but for the demon it is not possible to understand this great mysterious science. There are a number of editions of this great book of knowledge. Some of them have commentaries by the devotees, and some of them have commentaries by the demons. Commentation by the devotees is real, whereas that of the demons is useless. Arjuna accepts Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and any commentary on the <em>Gītā</em> following in the footsteps of Arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great science. The demonic, however, do not accept Lord Kṛṣṇa as He is. Instead they concoct something about Kṛṣṇa and mislead general readers from the path of Kṛṣṇa’s instructions. Here is a warning about such misleading paths. One should try to follow the disciplic succession from Arjuna, and thus be beneﬁted by this great science of <em>Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā.</em></div>

<div class="para-no-indent">Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe Kṛṣṇa’s words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that Kṛṣṇa should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or Kṛṣṇa. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in transcendence. Of course, Kṛṣṇa also appeared as the son of Devakī on this earth. How Kṛṣṇa remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal original person, is very difﬁcult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before Kṛṣṇa so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That Kṛṣṇa is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since Kṛṣṇa is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that Kṛṣṇa would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons, who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, when Kṛṣṇa Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by Kṛṣṇa Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study Kṛṣṇa from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of Kṛṣṇa when they are spoken by Kṛṣṇa Himself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of Kṛṣṇa because they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider Kṛṣṇa an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that Kṛṣṇa is superhuman, that He is <em>sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha</em>&nbsp;– the eternal form of bliss and knowledge&nbsp;– that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the inﬂuence of time and space. A devotee of Kṛṣṇa, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna’s putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary human being, subject to the modes of material nature.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">In the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> (5.33) we have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord. It is stated there:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam<br />ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca<br />vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau<br />govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi</em></div>
<div class="purp">“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is the original person&nbsp;– absolute, infallible, without beginning. Although expanded into unlimited forms, He is still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually not understood by even the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.”</div>
<div class="para">It is also stated in <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> (5.39):</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan<br />nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu<br />kṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yo<br />govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi</em></div>
<div class="purp">“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is always situated in various incarnations such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as Kṛṣṇa, and who incarnates personally also.”</div>
<div class="para">In the <em>Vedas</em> also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the <em>vaidūrya</em> stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the <em>Vedas</em> (<em>vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau</em>). Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord Kṛṣṇa spoke the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> to the sun-god Vivasvān, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part-and-parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> as infallible (<em>acyuta</em>), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the <em>Gītā</em> cannot be understood by demonic brains. Kṛṣṇa remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His <em>sac-cid-ānanda</em> body. He is <em>advaita,</em> which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit&nbsp;– whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And because the Lord’s body and self are identical, His position is always different from that of the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse.</div>

<div class="trans"><strong>Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all living entities, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past “births,” whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difﬁcult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or Kṛṣṇa. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His <em>prakṛti,</em> or His form. <em>Prakṛti</em> means “nature,” as well as <em>svarūpa,</em> or “one’s own form.” The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no ﬁxed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, Kṛṣṇa appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a ﬂute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body, it still appears that Lord Kṛṣṇa grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth. But astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kurukṣetra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufﬁciently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-ﬁve years old. We never see a picture of Kṛṣṇa in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation&nbsp;– past, present and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance are like the sun’s rising, moving before us and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun has set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its ﬁxed position, but owing to our defective, insufﬁcient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And because Lord Kṛṣṇa’s appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency&nbsp;– and He is never contaminated by material nature. The <em>Vedas</em> also conﬁrm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn yet He still appears to take His birth in multimanifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also conﬁrm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In the <em>Bhāgavatam,</em> He appears before His mother as Nārāyaṇa, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, bestowed upon the living entities so that they can concentrate on the Supreme Lord as He is, and not on mental concoctions or imaginations, which the impersonalist wrongly thinks the Lord’s forms to be. The word <em>māyā,</em> or <em>ātma-māyā,</em> refers to the Lord’s causeless mercy, according to the <em>Viśva-kośa</em> dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next verse.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">The word <em>sṛjāmi</em> is signiﬁcant herein. <em>Sṛjāmi</em> cannot be used in the sense of creation, because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord’s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore, <em>sṛjāmi</em> means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of the Dvāpara-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium of the seventh Manu in one day of Brahmā, He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations, because He is completely free to act in many ways at His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles of religion are laid down in the <em>Vedas,</em> and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the <em>Vedas</em> makes one irreligious. In the <em>Bhāgavatam</em> it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The <em>Vedas</em> are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahmā, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles of <em>dharma,</em> or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<em>dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam</em>). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> The purpose of the <em>Vedas</em> is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the <em>Gītā,</em> that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and whenever such principles are disturbed by the demoniac, the Lord appears. From the <em>Bhāgavatam</em> we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the <em>Vedas.</em> Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacriﬁce for particular purposes in the <em>Vedas,</em> people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacriﬁce without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared in order to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every <em>avatāra,</em> or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an <em>avatāra</em> unless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same&nbsp;– to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona ﬁde representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form.</div>
<div class="para">The principles of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true in the beginner’s arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse Kṛṣṇa consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">According to <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> a <em>sādhu</em> (holy man) is a man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualiﬁcations of Kṛṣṇa consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a <em>sādhu.</em> And <em>duṣkṛtām</em> applies to those who do not care for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such miscreants, or <em>duṣkṛtām,</em> are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education, whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is accepted as a <em>sādhu,</em> even though such a person may be neither learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons Rāvaṇa and Kaṁsa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahlāda Mahārāja was the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devakī, the mother of Kṛṣṇa, was the sister of Kaṁsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because Kṛṣṇa was to be born of them. So Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared primarily to deliver Devakī rather than kill Kaṁsa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.</div>
<div class="para">In the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em> of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja, the following verses (<em>Madhya</em> 20.263–264) summarize these principles of incarnation:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>sṛṣṭi-hetu yei mūrti prapañce avatare<br />sei īśvara-mūrti ‘avatāra’ nāma dhare</em></div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>māyātīta paravyome sabāra avasthāna<br />viśve avatari’ dhare ‘avatāra’ nāma</em></div>
<div class="purp">“The <em>avatāra,</em> or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or <em>avatāra.</em> Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name <em>avatāra.</em>”</div>
<div class="para">There are various kinds of <em>avatāras,</em> such as <em>puruṣāvatāras, guṇāvatāras, līlāvatāras, śakty-āveśa avatāras, manvantara-avatāras</em> and <em>yugāvatāras</em>&nbsp;– all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord Kṛṣṇa is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all <em>avatāras.</em> Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa descends for the speciﬁc purpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original Vṛndāvana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the Kṛṣṇa <em>avatāra</em> is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.</div>
<div class="para">The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the Age of Kali. As stated in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> the incarnation in the Age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who spread the worship of Kṛṣṇa by the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement (congregational chanting of the holy names) and spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the conﬁdential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the <em>Upaniṣads, Mahābhārata</em> and <em>Bhāgavatam.</em> The devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa are very much attracted by the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement of Lord Caitanya. This <em>avatāra</em> of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by His causeless mercy.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">The Lord’s descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the sixth verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the <em>yogīs</em> attain liberation only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they achieve&nbsp;– merging into the impersonal <em>brahma-jyotir</em> of the Lord&nbsp;– is only partial, and there is the risk of returning to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning to this material world. In the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> (5.33) it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and incarnations: <em>advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam.</em> Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers. As stated in the <em>Vedas</em> (<em>Puruṣa-bodhinī Upaniṣad</em>):</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>eko devo nitya-līlānurakto<br />bhakta-vyāpī hṛdy antar-ātmā</em></div>
<div class="purp">“The one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees.” This Vedic version is conﬁrmed in this verse of the <em>Gītā</em> personally by the Lord. He who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the <em>Vedas</em> and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The Vedic version <em>tat tvam asi</em> is actually applied in this case. Anyone who understands Lord Kṛṣṇa to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, “You are the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead,” is certainly liberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection, and this is conﬁrmed by the following Vedic assertion:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>tam eva viditvāti mṛtyum eti<br />nānyaḥ panthā vidyate ’yanāya</em></div>
<div class="purp">“One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there is no other way to achieve this perfection.” (<em>Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad</em> 3.8) That there is no alternative means that anyone who does not understand Lord Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance and consequently he will not attain salvation simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> according to mundane scholarship. Such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed-up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">As described above, it is very difﬁcult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand how the Supreme can be a person. Such materialists cannot even imagine that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all. Being embarrassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of material consciousness: attachment to material life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that arises from frustration in life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona ﬁde spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is called <em>bhāva,</em> or transcendental love of Godhead.</div>
<div class="para">According to <em>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu </em>(1.4.15–16), the science of devotional service:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-<br />saṅgo ’tha bhajana-kriyā<br />tato ’nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt<br />tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ</em></div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>athāsaktis tato bhāvas<br />tataḥ premābhyudañcati<br />sādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ<br />prādurbhāve bhavet kramaḥ</em></div>
<div class="purp">“In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated. In the next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is matured in <em>bhāva,</em> or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called <em>prema,</em> the highest perfectional stage of life.” In the <em>prema</em> stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona ﬁde spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all material attachment, from the fearfulness of one’s individual spiritual personality, and from the frustrations that result in void philosophy. Then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">Everyone is searching for Kṛṣṇa in the different aspects of His manifestations. Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His impersonal <em>brahma-jyotir</em> effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling within everything, including the particles of atoms. But Kṛṣṇa is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, Kṛṣṇa is the object of everyone’s realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisﬁed according to one’s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, Kṛṣṇa reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may want Kṛṣṇa as supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son and still another as his lover. Kṛṣṇa rewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity, Kṛṣṇa helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their individuality. Some of them, who are not ﬁrmly situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material ﬁeld to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitted into the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the <em>yajñeśvara;</em> and those who are <em>yogīs</em> seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers. In other words, everyone is dependent for success upon His mercy alone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (2.3.10):</div>

<div class="trans"><strong>Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities, and therefore they worship the demigods. Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in this world.</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">There is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God’s different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The <em>Vedas</em> say, <em>nityo nityānām:</em> God is one. <em>Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ.</em> The Supreme God is one&nbsp;– Kṛṣṇa&nbsp;– and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities (<em>nityānām</em>) with different grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme God&nbsp;– Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa. Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or <em>pāṣaṇḍī.</em> Even the great demigods like Brahmā and Śiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahmā and Śiva (<em>śiva-viriñci-nutam</em>). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. <em>Iha devatāḥ</em> denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (<em>hṛta-jñāna</em>) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary beneﬁt. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, people worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or “big guns” in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are not interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worshiping empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">The Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called <em>brāhmaṇas</em> due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically called the <em>kṣatriyas</em> due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the <em>vaiśyas,</em> are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the <em>śūdras,</em> or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord Kṛṣṇa does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the above-mentioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, is above even the <em>brāhmaṇas.</em> Although <em>brāhmaṇas</em> by quality are supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth, most of them approach only the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord Kṛṣṇa. But a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, becomes a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness&nbsp;– or, in other words, a Vaiṣṇava. Kṛṣṇa consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of Kṛṣṇa, namely Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha, etc. And as Kṛṣṇa is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">As there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can do no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the activities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratiﬁcation, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For advancement of sense gratiﬁcation, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic <em>smṛti</em> conﬁrms this fact as follows:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>nimitta-mātram evāsau<br />sṛjyānāṁ sarga-karmaṇi<br />pradhāna-kāraṇī-bhūtā<br />yato vai sṛjya-śaktayaḥ</em></div>
<div class="purp">“In the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate cause is material nature, by which the cosmic manifestation is made visible.” The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never responsible for their past and present activities. In the <em>Vedānta-sūtra</em> (2.1.34) it is conﬁrmed, <em>vaiṣamya-nairghṛṇye na sāpekṣatvāt:</em> the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity is responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this law of <em>karma,</em> or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of <em>karma.</em> One who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reactions. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul ﬁxed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is equally beneﬁcial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty things can take to the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness for a gradual cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby be beneﬁted. Foolish persons or neophytes in Kṛṣṇa consciousness often want to retire from activities without having knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Arjuna’s desire to retire from activities on the battleﬁeld was not approved by the Lord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is less important than actually engaging in the ﬁeld of activities for the sake of Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna is here advised to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, following in the footsteps of the Lord’s previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasvān, as mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well as those of persons who acted in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the past. Therefore He recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some millions of years before. All such students of Lord Kṛṣṇa are mentioned here as past liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted by Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="para">To act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning of this chapter. The system of Kṛṣṇa consciousness was ﬁrst narrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son Ikṣvāku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time. Therefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession. Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For this reason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in Kṛṣṇa consciousness directly. Because of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.</div>
<div class="para">It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect experimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid down by the Lord Himself. <em>Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam </em>(<em>Bhāg.</em> 6.3.19). No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahmā, Śiva, Nārada, Manu, the Kumāras, Kapila, Prahlāda, Bhīṣma, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, Yamarāja, Janaka and Bali Mahārāja. By mental speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization. Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">Becoming fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, one is freed from all dualities and thus is free from the contaminations of the material modes. He can become liberated because he knows his constitutional position in relationship with Kṛṣṇa, and thus his mind cannot be drawn from Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Consequently, whatever he does, he does for Kṛṣṇa, who is the primeval Viṣṇu. Therefore, all his works are technically sacriﬁces because sacriﬁce aims at satisfying the Supreme Person, Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa. The resultant reactions to all such work certainly merge into transcendence, and one does not suffer material effects.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">How activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present, just the principle of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is described. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by Kṛṣṇa consciousness as set forth here in the <em>Gītā.</em> This process is generally known as <em>yajña,</em> or activities (sacriﬁces) simply meant for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa. The more the activities of the material world are performed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or for Viṣṇu only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. The word <em>brahma</em> (Brahman) means “spiritual.” The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called <em>brahma-jyotir,</em> His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that <em>brahma-jyotir,</em> but when the <em>jyotir</em> is covered by illusion (<em>māyā</em>) or sense gratiﬁcation, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by Kṛṣṇa consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution, the process of consumption, the contributor and the result are&nbsp;– all combined together&nbsp;– Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by <em>māyā</em> is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is said to be in <em>samādhi,</em> or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called <em>yajña,</em> or sacriﬁce for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance and the result or ultimate gain&nbsp;– everything&nbsp;– becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>

<div class="trans"><strong>Some yogīs perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacriﬁces to them, and some offer sacriﬁces in the ﬁre of the Supreme Brahman.</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is also called a perfect <em>yogī</em> or a ﬁrst-class mystic. But there are others also, who perform similar sacriﬁces in the worship of demigods, and still others who sacriﬁce to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacriﬁces in terms of different categories. Such different categories of sacriﬁce by different types of performers only superﬁcially demark varieties of sacriﬁce. Factually sacriﬁce means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, who is also known as Yajña. All the different varieties of sacriﬁce can be placed within two primary divisions: namely, sacriﬁce of worldly possessions and sacriﬁce in pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness sacriﬁce all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacriﬁce their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacriﬁce their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material beneﬁts worship the demigods by various sacriﬁces according to the Vedic rituals. They are called <em>bahv-īśvara-vādī,</em> or believers in many gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacriﬁce their individual selves in the supreme ﬁre and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists sacriﬁce their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacriﬁce their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacriﬁces his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the ﬁre altar of sacriﬁce is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the ﬁre of Brahman. The Kṛṣṇa conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacriﬁces everything for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self&nbsp;– everything&nbsp;– is sacriﬁced for Kṛṣṇa. Thus, he is the ﬁrst-class <em>yogī;</em> but he does not lose his individual existence.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">The members of the four divisions of human life, namely the <em>brahmacārī,</em> the <em>gṛhastha,</em> the <em>vānaprastha</em> and the <em>sannyāsī,</em> are all meant to become perfect <em>yogīs</em> or transcendentalists. Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense gratiﬁcation like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life. The <em>brahmacārīs,</em> or students under the care of a bona ﬁde spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining from sense gratiﬁcation. A <em>brahmacārī</em> hears only words concerning Kṛṣṇa consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and therefore the pure <em>brahmacārī</em> engages fully in <em>harer nāmānukīrtanam</em>&nbsp;– chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. He restrains himself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in the transcendental sound vibration of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, the householders, who have some license for sense gratiﬁcation, perform such acts with great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat-eating are general tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted sex life and other sense gratiﬁcation. Marriage on the principles of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a kind of <em>yajña</em> because the restricted householder sacriﬁces his general tendency toward sense gratiﬁcation for higher, transcendental life.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">The <em>yoga</em> system conceived by Patañjali is referred to herein. In the <em>Yoga-sūtra</em> of Patañjali, the soul is called <em>pratyag-ātmā</em> and <em>parāg-ātmā.</em> As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called <em>parāg-ātmā,</em> but as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is called <em>pratyag-ātmā.</em> The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Patañjali system of <em>yoga</em> instructs one on how to control the functions of the body’s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this <em>yoga</em> system, <em>pratyag-ātmā</em> is the ultimate goal. This <em>pratyag-ātmā</em> is withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, and hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of the <em>prāṇa-vāyu.</em> The <em>apāna-vāyu</em> goes downwards, <em>vyāna-vāyu</em> acts to shrink and expand, <em>samāna-vāyu</em> adjusts equilibrium, <em>udāna-vāyu</em> goes upwards&nbsp;– and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">These sacriﬁces may be ﬁtted into various divisions. There are persons who are sacriﬁcing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities. In India, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of charitable institutions like <em>dharma-śālā, anna-kṣetra, atithi-śālā, anāthālaya</em> and <em>vidyā-pīṭha.</em> In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education and medical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are called <em>dravyamaya-yajña.</em> There are others who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as <em>candrāyaṇa</em> and <em>cāturmāsya.</em> These processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under the <em>cāturmāsya</em> vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day or does not leave home. Such sacriﬁce of the comforts of life is called <em>tapomaya-yajña.</em> There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic <em>yogas</em> like the Patañjali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or <em>haṭha-yoga</em> or <em>aṣṭāṅga-yoga</em> (for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctiﬁed places of pilgrimage. All these practices are called <em>yoga-yajña,</em> sacriﬁce for a certain type of perfection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic literatures, speciﬁcally the <em>Upaniṣads</em> and <em>Vedānta-sūtras,</em> or the Sāṅkhya philosophy. All of these are called <em>svādhyāya-yajña,</em> or engagement in the sacriﬁce of studies. All these <em>yogīs</em> are faithfully engaged in different types of sacriﬁce and are seeking a higher status of life. Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, is different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme Lord. Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacriﬁce but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona ﬁde devotees. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is transcendental.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">This system of <em>yoga</em> for controlling the breathing process is called <em>prāṇāyāma,</em> and in the beginning it is practiced in the <em>haṭha-yoga</em> system through different sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves controlling the airs within the body so as to reverse the directions of their passage. The <em>apāna</em> air goes downward, and the <em>prāṇa</em> air goes up. The <em>prāṇāyāma-yogī</em> practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into <em>pūraka,</em> equilibrium. Offering the exhaled breath into the inhaled breath is called <em>recaka.</em> When both air currents are completely stopped, one is said to be in <em>kumbhaka-yoga.</em> By practice of <em>kumbhaka-yoga,</em> one can increase the duration of life for perfection in spiritual realization. The intelligent <em>yogī</em> is interested in attaining perfection in one life, without waiting for the next. For by practicing <em>kumbhaka-yoga,</em> the <em>yogīs</em> increase the duration of life by many, many years. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord Kṛṣṇa; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation, as stated in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (14.26):</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>māṁ ca yo ’vyabhicāreṇa<br />bhakti-yogena sevate<br />sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br />brahma-bhūyāya kalpate</em></div>
<div class="purp">“One who engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord transcends the modes of material nature and is immediately elevated to the spiritual platform.” A Kṛṣṇa conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only <em>kṛṣṇa-prasādam,</em> or food which is offered ﬁrst to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement.</div>

This platform is in the eternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacriﬁces help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By this advancement in life, not only does one become happy and opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">Whatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant of his real situation. In other words, existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and sinful life is the cause of one’s dragging on in material existence. The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement. The <em>Vedas,</em> therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratiﬁcation and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacriﬁce recommended above, automatically solves our economic problems. By performance of <em>yajña</em> we can have enough food, enough milk, etc.&nbsp;– even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The <em>Vedas</em> prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratiﬁcation. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of <em>yajña</em> (sacriﬁce), as described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform <em>yajña</em> according to the <em>Vedas,</em> how can he expect a happy life even in this body, and what to speak of another body on another planet? There are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of <em>yajña.</em> But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material existence.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">Different types of sacriﬁce, as discussed above, are mentioned in the <em>Vedas</em> to suit the different types of worker. Because men are so deeply absorbed in the bodily concept, these sacriﬁces are so arranged that one can work either with the body, with the mind or with the intelligence. But all of them are recommended for ultimately bringing about liberation from the body. This is conﬁrmed by the Lord herewith from His own mouth.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">The purpose of all sacriﬁces is to arrive at the status of complete knowledge, then to gain release from material miseries and, ultimately, to engage in loving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord (Kṛṣṇa consciousness). Nonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different activities of sacriﬁce, and one should know this mystery. Sacriﬁces sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the performer. When one’s faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacriﬁces should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacriﬁce material possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge, sacriﬁces remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual beneﬁt. Real knowledge culminates in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental knowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacriﬁces are simply material activities. When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental knowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform. Depending on differences in consciousness, sacriﬁcial activities are sometimes called <em>karma-kāṇḍa</em> (fruitive activities) and sometimes <em>jñāna-kāṇḍa</em> (knowledge in the pursuit of truth). It is better when the end is knowledge.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">The path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difﬁcult. The Lord therefore advises us to approach a bona ﬁde spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona ﬁde spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders. The <em>Bhāgavatam</em> (6.3.19) says, <em>dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam:</em> the path of religion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the right path. Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona ﬁde spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. Not only should one hear submissively from the spiritual master, but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona ﬁde spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect.</div>

<div class="trans"><strong>Having obtained real knowledge from a self-realized soul, you will never fall again into such illusion, for by this knowledge you will see that all living beings are but part of the Supreme, or, in other words, that they are Mine.</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">The result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The sense of an existence separate from Kṛṣṇa is called <em>māyā</em> (<em>mā</em>&nbsp;– not, <em>yā</em>&nbsp;– this). Some think that we have nothing to do with Kṛṣṇa, that Kṛṣṇa is only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> it is clearly stated that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of Kṛṣṇa. The Māyāvādī philosophers wrongly think that Kṛṣṇa loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But the Māyāvādī philosophers fail to understand that <em>absolute</em> means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.</div>
<div class="para">For want of sufﬁcient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from Kṛṣṇa. Although we are separated parts of Kṛṣṇa, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is <em>māyā,</em> or not actual fact. We are all meant to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. By <em>māyā</em> alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with Kṛṣṇa. The whole teaching of the <em>Gītā</em> is targeted toward this end: that a living being, as Kṛṣṇa’s eternal servitor, cannot be separated from Kṛṣṇa, and his sense of being an identity apart from Kṛṣṇa is called <em>māyā.</em> The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to fulﬁll. Having forgotten that purpose since time immemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service through Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona ﬁde spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to Kṛṣṇa. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, Kṛṣṇa, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of Kṛṣṇa. When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as conﬁrmed in the <em>Bhāgavatam</em> (2.10.6): <em>muktir hitvānyathā-rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ.</em> Liberation means to be situated in one’s constitutional position as an eternal servitor of Kṛṣṇa (Kṛṣṇa consciousness).</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">The <em>yoga </em>system instructed in this chapter is called<em> sanātana-yoga, </em>or eternal activities performed by the living entity. This<em> yoga </em>has two divisions of sacriﬁcial actions: one is called sacriﬁce of one’s material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacriﬁce of one’s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacriﬁce becomes material. But one who performs such sacriﬁces with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacriﬁce. When we come to<em> </em>spiritual activities, we ﬁnd that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one’s own self (or one’s constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path of <em>Bhagavad-gītā </em>as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difﬁculty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is beneﬁcial, for such a person can easily understand the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the<em> Gītā </em>is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is awakened by different types of sacriﬁces to the demigods, sacriﬁce to Brahman, sacriﬁce in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in forgoing material possessions, in studying the <em>Vedas </em>and in partaking of the social institution called<em> varṇāśrama-dharma</em>.<em> </em>All of these are known as sacriﬁce, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of <em>Bhagavad-gītā, </em>but one who doubts the authority of Kṛṣṇa falls back. One is therefore advised to study<em> Bhagavad-gītā, </em>or any other scripture, under a bona ﬁde spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona ﬁde spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of <em>Bhagavad-gītā </em>have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of <em>Bhagavad-gītā </em>as it is expressed in the<em> Gītā </em>itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path. The Lord is deﬁnitely the supreme person, and His activities are transcendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of<em> Bhagavad-gītā</em>.</div>
