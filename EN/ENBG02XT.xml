<div class="trans"><strong>Sañjaya said: Seeing Arjuna full of compassion, his mind depressed, his eyes full of tears, Madhusūdana, Kṛṣṇa, spoke the following words.</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">Material compassion, lamentation and tears are all signs of ignorance of the real self. Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization. The word “Madhusūdana” is signiﬁcant in this verse. Lord Kṛṣṇa killed the demon Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted Kṛṣṇa to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress&nbsp;– the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a <em>śūdra,</em> or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a <em>kṣatriya,</em> and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This realization is possible when one works without attachment to fruitive results and is situated in the ﬁxed conception of the real self.</div>

<div class="trans"><strong>The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all beﬁtting a man who knows the value of life. They lead not to higher planets but to infamy.</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">Kṛṣṇa and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa is referred to as Bhagavān throughout the <em>Gītā.</em> Bhagavān is the ultimate in the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman, or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Paramātmā, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagavān, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa. In the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (1.2.11) this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>vadanti tat tattva-vidas<br />tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam<br />brahmeti paramātmeti<br />bhagavān iti śabdyate</em></div>
<div class="purp">“The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān.”</div>
<div class="para">These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun’s surface and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun’s surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisﬁed by simply understanding the sunshine&nbsp;– its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature&nbsp;– may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Paramātmā feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the <em>bhaktas,</em> or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagavān feature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category.</div>
<div class="para">The Sanskrit word <em>bhagavān</em> is explained by the great authority Parāśara Muni, the father of Vyāsadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagavān. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only Kṛṣṇa can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahmā, Lord Śiva or Nārāyaṇa, can possess opulences as fully as Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is concluded in the <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> by Lord Brahmā himself that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavān, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ<br />sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ<br />anādir ādir govindaḥ<br />sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</em></div>
<div class="purp">“There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavān, but Kṛṣṇa is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes.” (<em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> 5.1)</div>
<div class="para">In the <em>Bhāgavatam</em> also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Kṛṣṇa is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ<br />kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam<br />indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokaṁ<br />mṛḍayanti yuge yuge</em></div>
<div class="purp">“All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.” (<em>Bhāg.</em> 1.3.28)</div>
<div class="para">Therefore, Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.</div>
<div class="para">In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna’s lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Kṛṣṇa expressed His surprise with the word <em>kutaḥ,</em> “wherefrom.” Such impurities were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Āryans. The word <em>āryan</em> is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Viṣṇu, or Bhagavān, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-Āryans. Although Arjuna was a <em>kṣatriya,</em> he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to ﬁght. This act of cowardice is described as beﬁtting the non-Āryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord Kṛṣṇa did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">Arjuna was addressed as the son of Pṛthā, who happened to be the sister of Kṛṣṇa’s father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with Kṛṣṇa. If the son of a <em>kṣatriya</em> declines to ﬁght, he is a <em>kṣatriya</em> in name only, and if the son of a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> acts impiously, he is a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> in name only. Such <em>kṣatriyas</em> and <em>brāhmaṇas</em> are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, Kṛṣṇa did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a <em>kṣatriya.</em> Arjuna was the most intimate friend of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa was directly guiding him on the chariot; but in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle he would be committing an infamous act. Therefore Kṛṣṇa said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not ﬁt his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bhīṣma and his relatives, but Kṛṣṇa considered that sort of magnanimity mere weakness of heart. Such false magnanimity was not approved by any authority. Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called nonviolence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct guidance of Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">Arjuna did not know whether he should ﬁght and risk unnecessary violence, although ﬁghting is the duty of the <em>kṣatriyas,</em> or whether he should refrain and live by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only means of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side might emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was justiﬁed), still, if the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra died in battle, it would be very difﬁcult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be another kind of defeat for them. All these considerations by Arjuna deﬁnitely proved that not only was he a great devotee of the Lord but he was also highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desire to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign of detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his faith in the words of instruction of Śrī Kṛṣṇa (his spiritual master), indicate. It is concluded that Arjuna was quite ﬁt for liberation. Unless the senses are controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation. Arjuna was competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">By nature’s own way the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity for everyone. In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona ﬁde spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona ﬁde spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life, which happen without our desire. They are like a forest ﬁre that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants ﬁre, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona ﬁde spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse.</div>
<div class="para">Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the problems of life. In the <em>Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> (3.8.10) the perplexed man is described as follows: <em>yo vā etad akṣaraṁ gārgy aviditvāsmāḻ lokāt praiti sa kṛpaṇaḥ.</em> “He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization.” This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity, who can utilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other hand, there is the <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life. <em>Ya etad akṣaraṁ gārgi viditvāsmāl lokāt praiti sa brāhmaṇaḥ.</em></div>
<div class="para">The <em>kṛpaṇas,</em> or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of “skin disease.” The <em>kṛpaṇa</em> thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the <em>kṛpaṇa</em> thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals, who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities. Although he could understand that his duty to ﬁght was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord Kṛṣṇa, the supreme spiritual master, to make a deﬁnite solution. He offers himself to Kṛṣṇa as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. Kṛṣṇa is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> and Arjuna is the ﬁrst disciple for understanding the <em>Gītā.</em> How Arjuna understands the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is stated in the <em>Gītā</em> itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to Kṛṣṇa as a person, but to “the unborn within Kṛṣṇa.” There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa’s within and without. And one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em></div>

<div class="para-no-indent">Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord Kṛṣṇa. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in solving the problems of life; help can be given only by a spiritual master like Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent Kṛṣṇa conscious is the bona ﬁde spiritual master, for he can solve the problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is a master in the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual master.</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>kibā vipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya<br />yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei ‘guru’ haya</em></div>
<div class="purp">“It does not matter whether a person is a <em>vipra</em> [learned scholar in Vedic wisdom], or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life&nbsp;– if he is a master in the science of Kṛṣṇa, he is the perfect and bona ﬁde spiritual master.” (<em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya</em> 8.128) So without being a master in the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no one is a bona ﬁde spiritual master. It is also said in the Vedic literature:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇo vipro<br />mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ<br />avaiṣṇavo gurur na syād<br />vaiṣṇavaḥ śva-paco guruḥ</em></div>
<div class="purp">“A scholarly <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unﬁt to become a spiritual master without being a Vaiṣṇava, or expert in the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vaiṣṇava, or Kṛṣṇa conscious.” (<em>Padma Purāṇa</em>)</div>
<div class="para">The problems of material existence&nbsp;– birth, old age, disease and death&nbsp;– cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life, which are full of wealth and economically developed, yet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways, but they can achieve real happiness only if they consult Kṛṣṇa, or the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> and <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>&nbsp;– which constitute the science of Kṛṣṇa&nbsp;– through the bona ﬁde representative of Kṛṣṇa, the man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="para">If economic development and material comforts could drive away one’s lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivaled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would be unable to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy over the world can be ﬁnished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking on the moon planet, can also be ﬁnished at one stroke. The <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> conﬁrms this: <em>kṣīṇe puṇye martya-lokaṁ viśanti.</em> “When the results of pious activities are ﬁnished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life.” Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation.</div>
<div class="para">Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to solve his problem deﬁnitely, and that is the way of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>

Although Arjuna was, for the time being, overwhelmed with false grief due to family affection, he surrendered unto Kṛṣṇa, the supreme spiritual master, as a disciple. This indicated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and would then surely ﬁght. Thus Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s joy would be frustrated, since Arjuna would be enlightened by Kṛṣṇa and would ﬁght to the end.</div>

As friends, both of them were on the same level, but one of them voluntarily became a student of the other. Kṛṣṇa was smiling because a friend had chosen to become a disciple. As Lord of all, He is always in the superior position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord agrees to be a friend, a son or a lover for a devotee who wants Him in such a role. But when He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the master&nbsp;– with gravity, as it is required. It appears that the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the presence of both armies so that all were beneﬁted. So the talks of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> are not for any particular person, society, or community, but they are for all, and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">The Lord at once took the position of the teacher and chastised the student, calling him, indirectly, a fool. The Lord said, “You are talking like a learned man, but you do not know that one who is learned&nbsp;– one who knows what is body and what is soul&nbsp;– does not lament for any stage of the body, neither in the living nor in the dead condition.” As explained in later chapters, it will be clear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the controller of both. Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies. And because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul. One who knows this is actually learned, and for him there is no cause for lamentation, regardless of the condition of the material body.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">In the <em>Vedas&nbsp;– </em>in the <em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> as well as in the <em>Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad&nbsp;– </em>it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the maintainer of innumerable living entities, in terms of their different situations according to individual work and reaction of work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is also, by His plenary portions, alive in the heart of every living entity. Only saintly persons who can see, within and without, the same Supreme Lord can actually attain to perfect and eternal peace.</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām<br />eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān<br />tam ātma-sthaṁ ye ’nupaśyanti dhīrās<br />teṣāṁ śāntiḥ śāśvatī netareṣām</em></div>
<div class="verse-ref">(<em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> 2.2.13)</div>
<div class="purp">The same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world who pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge. The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna and all the kings who are assembled on the battleﬁeld are eternally individual beings and that the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned and in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord’s eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons. It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption. Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.</div>
<div class="para">The Māyāvādī theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of <em>māyā,</em> or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord Kṛṣṇa, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. Kṛṣṇa clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is conﬁrmed in the <em>Upaniṣads,</em> will continue eternally. This statement of Kṛṣṇa’s is authoritative because Kṛṣṇa cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact, then Kṛṣṇa would not have stressed it so much&nbsp;– even for the future. The Māyāvādī may argue that the individuality spoken of by Kṛṣṇa is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish Kṛṣṇa’s individuality? Kṛṣṇa afﬁrms His individuality in the past and conﬁrms His individuality in the future also. He has conﬁrmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. Kṛṣṇa has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing. The <em>Gītā</em> is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> When one accepts Kṛṣṇa as an ordinary man, the <em>Gītā</em> loses all importance. The Māyāvādī argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for Kṛṣṇa to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus conﬁrmed by great <em>ācāryas</em> like Śrī Rāmānuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the <em>Gītā</em> that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona ﬁde access to the great literature. The nondevotee’s approach to the teachings of the <em>Gītā</em> is something like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the <em>Gītā</em> be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the Māyāvādī explanation of the <em>Gītā</em> is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the Māyāvādīs and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the Māyāvādī philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the <em>Gītā.</em> If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is conﬁrmed by the <em>Vedas</em> as above mentioned.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth and sometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul ﬁnally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth&nbsp;– either material or spiritual&nbsp;– there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bhīṣma nor for Droṇa, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one’s work in life. So Bhīṣma and Droṇa, being noble souls, were surely going to have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.</div>
<div class="para">Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature&nbsp;– both material and spiritual&nbsp;– is called a <em>dhīra,</em> or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies.</div>
<div class="para">The Māyāvādī theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained, on the ground that the spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul’s being unchangeable. As conﬁrmed in the <em>Gītā,</em> the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally (<em>sanātana</em>) and are called <em>kṣara;</em> that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation the individual soul remains the same&nbsp;– fragmental. But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of reﬂection can be applied to the Supersoul, who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the Paramātmā. He is different from the individual living entity. When the sky is reﬂected in water, the reﬂections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same level with Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them are deluded by the illusory energy (<em>māyā</em>), then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of <em>māyā,</em> no one can be an authoritative instructor. Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by <em>māyā.</em></div>

Similarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the months of May and June, the hottest part of the summer season. One has to execute his duty in spite of climatic inconveniences. Similarly, to ﬁght is the religious principle of the <em>kṣatriyas,</em> and although one has to ﬁght with some friend or relative, one should not deviate from his prescribed duty.

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">Anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of spiritual realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and happiness is certainly a person eligible for liberation. In the <em>varṇāśrama</em> institution, the fourth stage of life, namely the renounced order (<em>sannyāsa</em>), is a painstaking situation. But one who is serious about making his life perfect surely adopts the <em>sannyāsa</em> order of life in spite of all difﬁculties. The difﬁculties usually arise from having to sever family relationships, to give up the connection of wife and children. But if anyone is able to tolerate such difﬁculties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete. Similarly, in Arjuna’s discharge of duties as a <em>kṣatriya,</em> he is advised to persevere, even if it is difﬁcult to ﬁght with his family members or similarly beloved persons. Lord Caitanya took <em>sannyāsa</em> at the age of twenty-four, and His dependents, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them. Yet for a higher cause He took <em>sannyāsa</em> and was steady in the discharge of higher duties. That is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">There is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing every moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body. But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of the body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and spirit. By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal. This conclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist and personalist. In the <em>Viṣṇu Purāṇa</em> (2.12.38) it is stated that Viṣṇu and His abodes all have self-illuminated spiritual existence (<em>jyotīṁṣi viṣṇur bhuvanāni viṣṇuḥ</em>). The words <em>existent</em> and <em>nonexistent</em> refer only to spirit and matter. That is the version of all seers of truth.</div>
<div class="para">This is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities who are bewildered by the inﬂuence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance involves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the worshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the part-and-parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can understand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study of oneself, the difference between oneself and the Supreme being understood as the relationship between the part and the whole. In the <em>Vedānta-sūtras,</em> as well as in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all emanations. Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural sequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be revealed in the Seventh Chapter. Although there is no difference between the energy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and the energy or nature is accepted as the subordinate. The living entities, therefore, are always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the servant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear knowledge is impossible to understand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the Lord teaches the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> for the enlightenment of all living entities for all time.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one’s own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul’s presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The <em>Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad</em> (5.9) conﬁrms this:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>bālāgra-śata-bhāgasya<br />śatadhā kalpitasya ca<br />bhāgo jīvaḥ sa vijñeyaḥ<br />sa cānantyāya kalpate</em></div>
<div class="purp">“When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.” Similarly the same version is stated:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya<br />śatāṁśaḥ sādṛśātmakaḥ<br />jīvaḥ sūkṣma-svarūpo ’yaṁ<br />saṅkhyātīto hi cit-kaṇaḥ</em></div>
<div class="purp">“There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.”</div>
<div class="para">Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the inﬂuence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the inﬂuence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the <em>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</em> (3.1.9) the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>eṣo ’ṇur ātmā cetasā veditavyo<br />yasmin prāṇaḥ pañcadhā saṁviveśa<br />prāṇaiś cittaṁ sarvam otaṁ prajānāṁ<br />yasmin viśuddhe vibhavaty eṣa ātmā</em></div>
<div class="purp">“The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is ﬂoating in the ﬁve kinds of air (<em>prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, samāna</em> and <em>udāna</em>), is situated within the heart, and spreads its inﬂuence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is puriﬁed from the contamination of the ﬁve kinds of material air, its spiritual inﬂuence is exhibited.”</div>
<div class="para">The <em>haṭha-yoga</em> system is meant for controlling the ﬁve kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures&nbsp;– not for any material proﬁt, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere.</div>
<div class="para">So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading <em>viṣṇu-tattva.</em></div>
<div class="para">The inﬂuence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body. According to the <em>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad,</em> this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is deﬁnitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away from this position, the activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science, however, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.</div>
<div class="para">Such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly, the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the Supreme Lord, called by the name <em>prabhā,</em> or superior energy. So whether one follows Vedic knowledge or modern science, one cannot deny the existence of the spirit soul in the body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> by the Personality of Godhead Himself.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">The material body is perishable by nature. It may perish immediately, or it may do so after a hundred years. It is a question of time only. There is no chance of maintaining it indeﬁnitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation, because the living entity as he is cannot be killed nor can the material body be saved for any length of time or permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the <em>Vedānta-sūtras</em> the living entity is qualiﬁed as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna was advised to ﬁght and not sacriﬁce the cause of religion for material, bodily considerations.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">When an embodied living entity is hurt by fatal weapons, it is to be known that the living entity within the body is not killed. The spirit soul is so small that it is impossible to kill him by any material weapon, as will be evident from subsequent verses. Nor is the living entity killable, because of his spiritual constitution. What is killed, or is supposed to be killed, is the body only. This, however, does not at all encourage killing of the body. The Vedic injunction is <em>mā hiṁsyāt sarvā bhūtāni:</em> never commit violence to anyone. Nor does understanding that the living entity is not killed encourage animal slaughter. Killing the body of anyone without authority is abominable and is punishable by the law of the state as well as by the law of the Lord. Arjuna, however, is being engaged in killing for the principle of religion, and not whimsically.</div>

<div class="trans-title">TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="trans"><strong>For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is called the steady, or <em>kūṭa-stha.</em> The body is subject to six kinds of transformations. It takes its birth from the womb of the mother’s body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing and primeval&nbsp;– that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul’s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.</div>
<div class="para">In the <em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> (1.2.18) we also ﬁnd a similar passage, which reads:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>na jāyate mriyate vā vipaścin<br />nāyaṁ kutaścin na babhūva kaścit<br />ajo nityaḥ śāśvato ’yaṁ purāṇo<br />na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</em></div>
<div class="purp">The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> but here in this verse there is one special word, <em>vipaścit,</em> which means learned or with knowledge.</div>
<div class="para">The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not ﬁnd the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not ﬁnd the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies&nbsp;– whether man or animal&nbsp;– we can understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge&nbsp;– past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa is not like the forgetful soul. If so, Kṛṣṇa’s teachings of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> would be useless.</div>
<div class="para">There are two kinds of souls&nbsp;– namely the minute particle soul (<em>aṇu-ātmā</em>) and the Supersoul (<em>vibhu-ātmā</em>). This is also conﬁrmed in the <em>Kaṭha Upaniṣad</em> (1.2.20) in this way:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān<br />ātmāsya jantor nihito guhāyām<br />tam akratuḥ paśyati vīta-śoko<br />dhātuḥ prasādān mahimānam ātmanaḥ</em></div>
<div class="purp">“Both the Supersoul [Paramātmā] and the atomic soul [ <em>jīvātmā</em>] are situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.” Kṛṣṇa is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by Kṛṣṇa, or by His bona ﬁde representative (the spiritual master).</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">Everything has its proper utility, and a man who is situated in complete knowledge knows how and where to apply a thing for its proper utility. Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with the person in knowledge. Although the justice of the peace awards capital punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be blamed, because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of justice. In <em>Manu-saṁhitā,</em> the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king’s punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneﬁcial. Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa orders ﬁghting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and thus Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of ﬁghting for Kṛṣṇa, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the ﬁghting to be executed by Arjuna at the instruction of Kṛṣṇa is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">Change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact. Even the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in a previous verse (2.13).</div>
<div class="para">Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulﬁlls the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulﬁlls the desire of another. The <em>Vedas,</em> like the <em>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad,</em> as well as the <em>Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad,</em> compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (Kṛṣṇa) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds&nbsp;– although they are the same in quality&nbsp;– one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. Kṛṣṇa is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one’s changing his position from one tree to another, or from one body to another. The <em>jīva</em> soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master&nbsp;– as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto Kṛṣṇa for instruction&nbsp;– the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the <em>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</em> (3.1.2) and <em>Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad</em> (4.7) conﬁrm this:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>samāne vṛkṣe puruṣo nimagno<br />’nīśayā śocati muhyamānaḥ<br />juṣṭaṁ yadā paśyaty anyam īśam<br />asya mahimānam iti vīta-śokaḥ</em></div>
<div class="purp">“Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend the Lord and knows His glories&nbsp;– at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.” Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, Kṛṣṇa, and is understanding the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> from Him. And thus, hearing from Kṛṣṇa, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.</div>
<div class="para">Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous ﬁght so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the sacriﬁcial altar, or in the proper battleﬁeld, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for Arjuna’s lamentation.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">All kinds of weapons&nbsp;– swords, ﬂame weapons, rain weapons, tornado weapons, etc.&nbsp;– are unable to kill the spirit soul. It appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of earth, water, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons of ﬁre. Even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are classiﬁed as ﬁre weapons, but formerly there were other weapons made of all different types of material elements. Fire weapons were counteracted by water weapons, which are now unknown to modern science. Nor do modern scientists have knowledge of tornado weapons. Nonetheless, the soul can never be cut into pieces, nor annihilated by any number of weapons, regardless of scientiﬁc devices.</div>
<div class="para">The Māyāvādī cannot explain how the individual soul came into existence simply by ignorance and consequently became covered by the illusory energy. Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Supreme Soul; rather, the individual souls are eternally separated parts of the Supreme Soul. Because they are atomic individual souls eternally (<em>sanātana</em>), they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of a ﬁre, although one in quality with the ﬁre, are prone to be extinguished when out of the ﬁre. In the <em>Varāha Purāṇa,</em> the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme. They are eternally so, according to the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> also. So, even after being liberated from illusion, the living entity remains a separate identity, as is evident from the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna. Arjuna became liberated by the knowledge received from Kṛṣṇa, but he never became one with Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">All these qualiﬁcations of the atomic soul deﬁnitely prove that the individual soul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole, and he remains the same atom eternally, without change. The theory of monism is very difﬁcult to apply in this case, because the individual soul is never expected to become one homogeneously. After liberation from material contamination, the atomic soul may prefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual planets to associate with the Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="para">The word <em>sarva-gata</em> (“all-pervading”) is signiﬁcant because there is no doubt that living entities are all over God’s creation. They live on the land, in the water, in the air, within the earth and even within ﬁre. The belief that they are sterilized in ﬁre is not acceptable, because it is clearly stated here that the soul cannot be burned by ﬁre. Therefore, there is no doubt that there are living entities also in the sun planet with suitable bodies to live there. If the sun globe is uninhabited, then the word <em>sarva-gata</em>&nbsp;– “living everywhere”&nbsp;– becomes meaningless.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">As described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material calculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope; therefore, he is invisible. As far as the soul’s existence is concerned, no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of <em>śruti,</em> or Vedic wisdom. We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception. There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority. No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his mother. There is no source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no source of understanding the soul except by studying the <em>Vedas.</em> In other words, the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and conscious&nbsp;– that also is the statement of the <em>Vedas,</em> and we have to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the inﬁnite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul is inﬁnite, and the atomic soul is inﬁnitesimal. Therefore, the inﬁnitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to the inﬁnite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This concept is repeated in the <em>Vedas</em> in different ways just to conﬁrm the stability of the conception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly, without error.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">There is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do not believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body. When Lord Kṛṣṇa spoke the <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the Lokāyatikas and Vaibhāṣikas. Such philosophers maintain that life symptoms take place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo religions&nbsp;– now becoming fashionable in America&nbsp;– are also adhering to this philosophy, as are the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.</div>
<div class="para">Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul&nbsp;– as in the Vaibhāṣika philosophy&nbsp;– there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientiﬁc warfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the Vaibhāṣika philosophy, the so-called soul or <em>ātmā</em> vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul or he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for such incidents. If there were no rebirth for the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected by sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, Kṛṣṇa sarcastically addressed Arjuna as <em>mahā-bāhu,</em> mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibhāṣikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom. As a <em>kṣatriya,</em> Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">One has to take birth according to one’s activities of life. And after ﬁnishing one term of activities, one has to die to take birth for the next.

<div class="para">The Battle of Kurukṣetra, being the will of the Supreme, was an inevitable event, and to ﬁght for the right cause is the duty of a <em>kṣatriya.</em> Why should he be afraid of or aggrieved at the death of his relatives since he was discharging his proper duty? He did not deserve to break the law, thereby becoming subjected to the reactions of sinful acts, of which he was so afraid.

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the existence of the soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for argument’s sake, we accept this atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of nonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, ﬁre is generated; from ﬁre, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested&nbsp;– that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference.</div>
<div class="para">And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time (<em>antavanta ime dehāḥ</em>) but that the soul is eternal (<em>nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ</em>), then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of ﬂying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul or one does not believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body.</div>

Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matters for sense gratiﬁcation that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps they have no idea that one must think of the soul, and thus make a solution to the material miseries.</div>
<div class="para">Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude. It is very difﬁcult to ﬁnd a man who perfectly understands the position of the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective functions and relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still more difﬁcult to ﬁnd a man who has actually derived full beneﬁt from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects.

<div class="para">The easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the statements of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> spoken by the greatest authority, Lord Kṛṣṇa, without being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a great deal of penance and sacriﬁce, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one is able to accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kṛṣṇa can, however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way.</div>

As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of his particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated, one’s <em>sva-dharma</em>&nbsp;– speciﬁc duty&nbsp;– becomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are speciﬁc duties for the <em>brāhmaṇas</em> and <em>kṣatriyas</em> respectively, and such duties are unavoidable. <em>Sva-dharma</em> is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clariﬁed in the Fourth Chapter. On the bodily plane <em>sva-dharma</em> is called <em>varṇāśrama-dharma,</em> or man’s steppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the stage of <em>varṇāśrama-dharma,</em> or speciﬁc duties in terms of the speciﬁc modes of nature of the body obtained. Discharging one’s speciﬁc duty in any ﬁeld of action in accordance with the orders of higher authorities serves to elevate one to a higher status of life.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">As supreme teacher of the world, Lord Kṛṣṇa condemns the attitude of Arjuna, who said, “I do not ﬁnd any good in this ﬁghting. It will cause perpetual habitation in hell.” Such statements by Arjuna were due to ignorance only. He wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his speciﬁc duty. For a <em>kṣatriya</em> to be on the battleﬁeld and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of fools. In the <em>Parāśara-smṛti,</em> or religious codes made by Parāśara, the great sage and father of Vyāsadeva, it is stated:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>kṣatriyo hi prajā rakṣan<br />śastra-pāṇiḥ pradaṇḍayan<br />nirjitya para-sainyādi<br />kṣitiṁ dharmeṇa pālayet</em></div>
<div class="purp">“The <em>kṣatriya’s</em> duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difﬁculties, and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and order. Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus, with religious principles, he should rule over the world.”</div>
<div class="para">Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from ﬁghting. If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets, whose doors were wide open to him. Fighting would be for his beneﬁt in either case.</div>

So he was credited with so many military certiﬁcates from many authorities, including his adoptive father Indra, the heavenly king.

<div class="para-no-indent">Lord Kṛṣṇa now directly says that Arjuna should ﬁght for the sake of ﬁghting because He desires the battle. There is no consideration of happiness or distress, proﬁt or loss, victory or defeat in the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That everything should be performed for the sake of Kṛṣṇa is transcendental consciousness; so there is no reaction to material activities. He who acts for his own sense gratiﬁcation, either in goodness or in passion, is subject to the reaction, good or bad. But he who has completely surrendered himself in the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is no longer obliged to anyone, nor is he a debtor to anyone, as one is in the ordinary course of activities. It is said:</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">According to the <em>Nirukti,</em> or the Vedic dictionary, <em>saṅkhyā</em> means that which describes things in detail, and <em>sāṅkhya</em> refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And <em>yoga</em> involves controlling the senses. Arjuna’s proposal not to ﬁght was based on sense gratiﬁcation. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease ﬁghting, because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratiﬁcation. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratiﬁcation, even at a sacriﬁce of wisdom and duty. Kṛṣṇa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as Sāṅkhya, in terms of the <em>Nirukti</em> dictionary. This Sāṅkhya has nothing to do with the Sāṅkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila’s Sāṅkhya, the Sāṅkhya philosophy was expounded in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who explained it to His mother, Devahūti. It is clearly explained by Him that the <em>puruṣa,</em> or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the <em>prakṛti.</em> This is accepted in the <em>Vedas</em> and in the <em>Gītā.</em> The description in the <em>Vedas</em> indicates that the Lord glanced over the <em>prakṛti,</em> or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratiﬁcation, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of <em>māyā,</em> or sense gratiﬁcatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratiﬁcatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto Vāsudeva, Lord Kṛṣṇa, thereby fulﬁlling the search after the ultimate truth.</div>
<div class="para">Arjuna has already accepted Kṛṣṇa as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: <em>śiṣyas te ’haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam.</em> Consequently, Kṛṣṇa will now tell him about the working process in <em>buddhi-yoga,</em> or <em>karma-yoga,</em> or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratiﬁcation of the Lord. This <em>buddhi-yoga</em> is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Paramātmā in everyone’s heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, attains to this stage of <em>buddhi-yoga</em> by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="para">Thus the <em>buddhi-yoga</em> mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word Sāṅkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic <em>sāṅkhya-yoga</em> enunciated by the imposter Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the <em>sāṅkhya-yoga</em> mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic Sāṅkhya. Nor did that philosophy have any inﬂuence during that time; nor would Lord Kṛṣṇa care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real Sāṅkhya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</em> but even that Sāṅkhya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, Sāṅkhya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord Kṛṣṇa made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of <em>buddhi-yoga,</em> or <em>bhakti-yoga.</em> Therefore, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s Sāṅkhya and Lord Kapila’s Sāṅkhya, as described in the <em>Bhāgavatam,</em> are one and the same. They are all <em>bhakti-yoga.</em> Lord Kṛṣṇa said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between <em>sāṅkhya-yoga</em> and <em>bhakti-yoga</em> (<em>sāṅkhya-yogau pṛthag bālāḥ pravadanti na paṇḍitāḥ</em>).</div>
<div class="para">Of course, atheistic <em>sāṅkhya-yoga</em> has nothing to do with <em>bhakti-yoga,</em> yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic <em>sāṅkhya-yoga</em> is referred to in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em></div>
<div class="para">One should therefore understand that <em>buddhi-yoga</em> means to work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difﬁcult such work may be, is working under the principles of <em>buddhi-yoga</em> and ﬁnds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental understanding automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratiﬁcation for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. <em>Buddhi-yoga</em> is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">Activity in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or acting for the beneﬁt of Kṛṣṇa without expectation of sense gratiﬁcation, is the highest transcendental quality of work. Even a small beginning of such activity ﬁnds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work begun in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not ﬁnished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in Kṛṣṇa consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent, whereas in material activity without a hundred percent success there is no proﬁt. Ajāmila performed his duty in some percentage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord. There is a nice verse in this connection in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (1.5.17):</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer<br />bhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadi<br />yatra kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kiṁ<br />ko vārtha āpto ’bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ</em></div>
<div class="purp">“If someone gives up his occupational duties and works in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? And what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly?” Or, as the Christians say, “What proﬁteth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffer the loss of his eternal soul?”</div>
<div class="para">Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness carries a person again to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even after the loss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured <em>brāhmaṇa</em> or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">A strong faith that by Kṛṣṇa consciousness one will be elevated to the highest perfection of life is called <em>vyavasāyātmikā</em> intelligence. The <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em> (<em>Madhya</em> 22.62) states:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>‘śraddhā’-śabde&nbsp;– viśvāsa kahe sudṛḍha niścaya<br />kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya</em></div>
<div class="purp">Faith means unﬂinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged in the duties of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity or nationality. Fruitive activities are the engagements of one’s reactions from past good or bad deeds. When one is awake in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically achieved by progressive Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="para">The resolute purpose of a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is based on knowledge. <em>Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ:</em> a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the rare good soul who knows perfectly that Vāsudeva, or Kṛṣṇa, is the root of all manifested causes. As by watering the root of a tree one automatically distributes water to the leaves and branches, so by acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness one can render the highest service to everyone&nbsp;– namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If Kṛṣṇa is satisﬁed by one’s actions, then everyone will be satisﬁed.</div>
<div class="para">Service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona ﬁde representative of Kṛṣṇa, who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As such, to be well versed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness one has to act ﬁrmly and obey the representative of Kṛṣṇa, and one should accept the instruction of the bona ﬁde spiritual master as one’s mission in life. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo<br />yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto ’pi<br />dhyāyan stuvaṁs tasya yaśas tri-sandhyaṁ<br />vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam</em></div>
<div class="purp">“By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisﬁed. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.”</div>
<div class="para">The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body&nbsp;– not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer a chance for sense gratiﬁcation manifested in fruitive activities. One who is not ﬁrmly ﬁxed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts.</div>

<div class="trans"><strong>Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the ﬂowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratiﬁcation and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the <em>karma-kāṇḍa</em> portions of the <em>Vedas.</em> They do not want anything more than sense gratiﬁcatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common. In the <em>Vedas</em> many sacriﬁces are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the Jyotiṣṭoma sacriﬁces. In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacriﬁces, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difﬁcult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As fools are attached to the ﬂowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, unenlightened men are similarly attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.</div>
<div class="para">In the <em>karma-kāṇḍa</em> section of the <em>Vedas</em> it is said, <em>apāma somam amṛtā abhūma</em> and <em>akṣayyaṁ ha vai cāturmāsya-yājinaḥ sukṛtaṁ bhavati.</em> In other words, those who perform the four-month penances become eligible to drink the <em>soma-rasa</em> beverages to become immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have <em>soma-rasa</em> to become strong and ﬁt to enjoy sense gratiﬁcations. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacriﬁces. They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called Nandana-kānana in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of <em>soma-rasa</em> wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to such material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The <em>Vedas</em> deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the ﬁeld of sense gratiﬁcation to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Kṛṣṇa, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of <em>Vedānta</em> philosophy where, in the beginning, there is <em>brahma-jijñāsā,</em> or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratiﬁcation, namely the <em>karma-kāṇḍa</em> chapter, are ﬁnished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the <em>Upaniṣads,</em> which are part of different <em>Vedas,</em> as the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is a part of the ﬁfth <em>Veda,</em> namely the <em>Mahābhārata.</em> The <em>Upaniṣads</em> mark the beginning of transcendental life.</div>
<div class="para">As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="trans"><strong>All purposes served by a small well can at once be served by a great reservoir of water. Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them.</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">The rituals and sacriﬁces mentioned in the <em>karma-kāṇḍa</em> division of the Vedic literature are meant to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (15.15): the purpose of studying the <em>Vedas</em> is to know Lord Kṛṣṇa, the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding Kṛṣṇa and one’s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities with Kṛṣṇa is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (15.7). The living entities are parts and parcels of Kṛṣṇa; therefore, revival of Kṛṣṇa consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is conﬁrmed in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (3.33.7) as follows:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>aho bata śva-paco ’to garīyān<br />yaj-jihvāgre vartate nāma tubhyam<br />tepus tapas te juhuvuḥ sasnur āryā<br />brahmānūcur nāma gṛṇanti ye te</em></div>
<div class="purp">“O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a <em>caṇḍāla</em> [dog-eater], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacriﬁces according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the Āryan family.”</div>
<div class="para">So one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the <em>Vedas,</em> without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratiﬁcation. It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals, nor is it possible to study all of the <em>Vedānta</em> and the <em>Upaniṣads</em> thoroughly. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the <em>Vedas.</em> This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying <em>Vedānta</em> philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master had found Him to be a great fool and thus asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In this Age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand <em>Vedānta</em> philosophy; the best purpose of <em>Vedānta</em> philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord. <em>Vedānta</em> is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the <em>Vedānta</em> philosophy is Lord Kṛṣṇa; and the highest Vedāntist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">There are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, and inaction. Prescribed duties are activities enjoined in terms of one’s acquired modes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction of authority, and inaction means not performing one’s prescribed duties. The Lord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions.</div>
<div class="para">As far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be ﬁtted into three subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities. Routine work performed as an obligation in terms of the scriptural injunctions, without desire for results, is action in the mode of goodness. Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not auspicious. Everyone has his proprietary right in regard to prescribed duties, but should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.</div>
<div class="para">Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to ﬁght as a matter of duty without attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation. Any attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful. Therefore, ﬁghting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of salvation for Arjuna.</div>

Gain or victory are Kṛṣṇa’s concern; Arjuna is simply advised to act according to the dictation of Kṛṣṇa. The following of Kṛṣṇa’s dictation is real <em>yoga,</em> and this is practiced in the process called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. By Kṛṣṇa consciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship. One has to become the servant of Kṛṣṇa, or the servant of the servant of Kṛṣṇa. That is the right way to discharge duty in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which alone can help one to act in <em>yoga.</em></div>
<div class="para">Arjuna is a <em>kṣatriya,</em> and as such he is participating in the <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em> institution.

Only misers desire to enjoy the fruit of their own work just to be further entangled in material bondage.

One should therefore never desire to be the cause of work. Everything should be done in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. Misers do not know how to utilize the assets of riches which they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor. One should spend all energies working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that will make one’s life successful.

<div class="trans"><strong>By thus engaging in devotional service to the Lord, great sages or devotees free themselves from the results of work in the material world. In this way they become free from the cycle of birth and death and attain the state beyond all miseries [by going back to Godhead].</strong></div>
<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">The liberated living entities belong to that place where there are no material miseries. The <em>Bhāgavatam</em> (10.14.58) says:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>samāṣritā ye pada-pallava-plavaṁ<br />mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ<br />bhavāmbudhir vatsa-padaṁ paraṁ padaṁ<br />padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām</em></div>
<div class="purp">“For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mukunda, or the giver of <em>mukti,</em> the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf’s footprint. <em>Paraṁ padam,</em> or the place where there are no material miseries, or Vaikuṇṭha, is his goal, not the place where there is danger in every step of life.”</div>
<div class="para">Owing to ignorance, one does not know that this material world is a miserable place where there are dangers at every step. Out of ignorance only, less intelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive activities, thinking that the resultant actions will make them happy. They do not know that no kind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life without miseries. The miseries of life, namely birth, death, old age and diseases, are present everywhere within the material world. But one who understands his real constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the position of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Consequently he becomes qualiﬁed to enter into the Vaikuṇṭha planets, where there is neither material, miserable life nor the inﬂuence of time and death. To know one’s constitutional position means to know also the sublime position of the Lord. One who wrongly thinks that the living entity’s position and the Lord’s position are on the same level is to be understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord. He becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way for the repetition of birth and death. But one who, understanding that his position is to serve, transfers himself to the service of the Lord, at once becomes eligible for Vaikuṇṭha-loka. Service for the cause of the Lord is called <em>karma-yoga</em> or <em>buddhi-yoga,</em> or in plain words, devotional service to the Lord.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">There are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the Lord of those who became indifferent to the rituals of the <em>Vedas</em> simply by devotional service to the Lord. When a person factually understands Kṛṣṇa and his relationship with Kṛṣṇa, he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced <em>brāhmaṇa.</em> Śrī Mādhavendra Purī, a great devotee and <em>ācārya</em> in the line of the devotees, says:</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>sandhyā-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bhoḥ snāna tubhyaṁ namo<br />bho devāḥ pitaraś ca tarpaṇa-vidhau nāhaṁ kṣamaḥ kṣamyatām<br />yatra kvāpi niṣadya yādava-kulottaṁsasya kaṁsa-dviṣaḥ<br />smāraṁ smāram aghaṁ harāmi tad alaṁ manye kim anyena me</em></div>
<div class="purp">“O my prayers three times a day, all glory to you. O bathing, I offer my obeisances unto you. O demigods! O forefathers! Please excuse me for my inability to offer you my respects. Now wherever I sit, I can remember the great descendant of the Yadu dynasty [Kṛṣṇa], the enemy of Kaṁsa, and thereby I can free myself from all sinful bondage. I think this is sufﬁcient for me.”</div>
<div class="para">The Vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes: comprehending all kinds of prayer three times a day, taking a bath early in the morning, offering respects to the forefathers, etc. But when one is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and is engaged in His transcendental loving service, one becomes indifferent to all these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection. If one can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacriﬁces as recommended in revealed scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood that the purpose of the <em>Vedas</em> is to reach Kṛṣṇa and simply engages in the rituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements. Persons in Kṛṣṇa consciousness transcend the limit of <em>śabda-brahma,</em> or the range of the <em>Vedas</em> and <em>Upaniṣads.</em></div>

A Kṛṣṇa conscious person, or unﬂinching devotee of the Lord, should not be disturbed by the ﬂowery language of the <em>Vedas</em> nor be engaged in fruitive activities for promotion to the heavenly kingdom. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one comes directly into communion with Kṛṣṇa, and thus all directions from Kṛṣṇa may be understood in that transcendental state. One is sure to achieve results by such activities and attain conclusive knowledge. One has only to carry out the orders of Kṛṣṇa or His representative, the spiritual master.</div>

One can know his speciﬁc symptoms from the <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> Most important is how the man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness speaks; for speech is the most important quality of any man. It is said that a fool is undiscovered as long as he does not speak, and certainly a well-dressed fool cannot be identiﬁed unless he speaks, but as soon as he speaks, he reveals himself at once. The immediate symptom of a Kṛṣṇa conscious man is that he speaks only of Kṛṣṇa and of matters relating to Him. Other symptoms then automatically follow, as stated below.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">The <em>Bhāgavatam</em> afﬁrms that any person who is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or devotional service of the Lord, has all the good qualities of the great sages, whereas a person who is not so transcendentally situated has no good qualiﬁcations, because he is sure to be taking refuge in his own mental concoctions. Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction. Artiﬁcially, such sense desires cannot be stopped. But if one is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous efforts. Therefore, one has to engage himself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness without hesitation, for this devotional service will instantly help one onto the platform of transcendental consciousness. The highly developed soul always remains satisﬁed in himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord. Such a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from petty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the Supreme Lord.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">The word <em>muni</em> means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for mental speculation without coming to a factual conclusion. It is said that every <em>muni</em> has a different angle of vision, and unless a <em>muni</em> differs from other <em>munis,</em> he cannot be called a <em>muni</em> in the strict sense of the term. <em>Nāsāv ṛṣir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam</em> (<em>Mahābhārata, Vana-parva</em> 313.117). But a <em>sthita-dhīr muni,</em> as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary <em>muni.</em> The <em>sthita-dhīr muni</em> is always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He is called <em>praśānta-niḥśeṣa-mano-rathāntara</em> (<em>Stotra-ratna</em> 43), or one who has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, or Vāsudeva, is everything (<em>vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ</em>). He is called a <em>muni</em> ﬁxed in mind. Such a fully Kṛṣṇa conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord’s grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not inﬂuenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things for one’s own sense gratiﬁcation, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one ﬁxed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. Success or no success, a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is always steady in his determination.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">The test of a <em>yogī,</em> devotee or self-realized soul is that he is able to control the senses according to his plan. Most people, however, are servants of the senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer to the question as to how the <em>yogī</em> is situated. The senses are compared to venomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The <em>yogī,</em> or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents&nbsp;– like a snake charmer. He never allows them to act independently. There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not’s, and some of them are do’s. Unless one is able to follow the do’s and the do-not’s, restricting oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be ﬁrmly ﬁxed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at any moment wind up its senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes. Similarly, the senses of the Kṛṣṇa conscious persons are used only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are withdrawn otherwise. Arjuna is being taught here to use his senses for the service of the Lord, instead of for his own satisfaction. Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense enjoyment. The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions nor loses his taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like <em>aṣṭāṅga-yoga,</em> in the matter of <em>yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā, dhyāna,</em> etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, in the course of his advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead, material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good until one actually has a taste for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When one is actually Kṛṣṇa conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things.</div>

<div class="purp">“Since my mind has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and I have been enjoying an ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my face at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought.”</div>
<div class="para">Kṛṣṇa consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically material enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man had satisﬁed his hunger by a sufﬁcient quantity of nutritious eatables. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa also conquered a great <em>yogī,</em> Durvāsā Muni, simply because his mind was engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness (<em>sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane</em>).</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">That the highest conception of <em>yoga</em> perfection is Kṛṣṇa consciousness is clearly explained in this verse. And unless one is Kṛṣṇa conscious it is not at all possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durvāsā Muni picked a quarrel with Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, and Durvāsā Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand, the king, although not as powerful a <em>yogī</em> as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage’s injustices and thereby emerged victorious. The king was able to control his senses because of the following qualiﬁcations, as mentioned in the <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (9.4.18–20):</div>
<div class="verse-in-purp"><em>sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor<br />vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane<br />karau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣu<br />śrutiṁ cakārācyuta-sat-kathodaye</em></div>

<div class="purp">“King Ambarīṣa ﬁxed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, engaged his words in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in smelling the ﬂavor of the ﬂowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his tongue in tasting the <em>tulasī</em> leaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the holy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in fulﬁlling the desires of the Lord&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;and all these qualiﬁcations made him ﬁt to become a <em>mat-para</em> devotee of the Lord.”</div>
<div class="para">The word <em>mat-para</em> is most signiﬁcant in this connection. How one can become <em>mat-para</em> is described in the life of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, a great scholar and <em>ācārya</em> in the line of the <em>mat-para,</em> remarks, <em>mad-bhakti-prabhāvena sarvendriya-vijaya-pūrvikā svātma-dṛṣṭiḥ su-labheti bhāvaḥ.</em> “The senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa.” Also, the example of ﬁre is sometimes given: “As a blazing ﬁre burns everything within a room, Lord Viṣṇu, situated in the heart of the <em>yogī,</em> burns up all kinds of impurities.” The <em>Yoga-sūtra</em> also prescribes meditation on Viṣṇu, and not meditation on the void. The so-called <em>yogīs</em> who meditate on something other than the Viṣṇu form simply waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria. We have to be Kṛṣṇa conscious&nbsp;– devoted to the Personality of Godhead. This is the aim of the real <em>yoga.</em></div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">One who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious is subjected to material desires while contemplating the objects of the senses. The senses require real engagements, and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism. In the material world everyone, including Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā&nbsp;– to say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets&nbsp;– is subjected to the inﬂuence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Lord Śiva was deep in meditation, but when Pārvatī agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result Kārtikeya was born. When Haridāsa Ṭhākura was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation of Māyā-devī, but Haridāsa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord Kṛṣṇa. As illustrated in the above-mentioned verse of Śrī Yāmunācārya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of the Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artiﬁcial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires.</div>

<div class="verse-ref">(<em>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu </em>1.2.258)<em></em></div>
<div class="purp">By development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness one can know that everything has its use in the service of the Lord. Those who are without knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness artiﬁcially try to avoid material objects, and as a result, although they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the perfect stage of renunciation. Their so-called renunciation is called <em>phalgu,</em> or less important. On the other hand, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called <em>prasādam.</em> Thus everything becomes spiritualized, and there is no danger of a downfall. The devotee takes <em>prasādam</em> in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, whereas the nondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life, due to his artiﬁcial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence. It is said that such a soul, even though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down again due to his not having support in devotional service.</div>

Although the person in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane, because of his being Kṛṣṇa conscious he has no attachment to sensual activities. The Kṛṣṇa conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, and nothing else. Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment and detachment. If Kṛṣṇa wants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if Kṛṣṇa does not want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction of Kṛṣṇa. This consciousness is the causeless mercy of the Lord, which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the sensual platform.</div>

<div class="para-no-indent">Unless one is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no possibility of peace. So it is conﬁrmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that Kṛṣṇa is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacriﬁce and penance, that He is the proprietor of all universal manifestations, and that He is the real friend of all living entities, then only can one have real peace. Therefore, if one is not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there cannot be a ﬁnal goal for the mind. Disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain that Kṛṣṇa is the enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a steady mind, bring about peace. Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship with Kṛṣṇa is certainly always in distress and is without peace, however much he may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship with Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="purp-title">PURPORT</div>
<div class="para-no-indent">To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratiﬁcation. In other words, desire for becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious is actually desirelessness. To understand one’s actual position as the eternal servitor of Kṛṣṇa, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor of everything, everything must be used for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna did not want to ﬁght for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully Kṛṣṇa conscious he fought because Kṛṣṇa wanted him to ﬁght. For himself there was no desire to ﬁght, but for Kṛṣṇa the same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Real desirelessness is desire for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, not an artiﬁcial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa (<em>īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam</em>), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization&nbsp;– namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is an eternal part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa in spiritual identity, and that the eternal position of the living entity is therefore never on the level of Kṛṣṇa or greater than Him. This understanding of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the basic principle of real peace.</div>

<div class="trans"><strong>That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. If one is thus situated even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.</strong></div>

<div class="para-no-indent">One can attain Kṛṣṇa consciousness or divine life at once, within a second&nbsp;– or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Khaṭvāṅga Mahārāja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto Kṛṣṇa. <em>Nirvāṇa</em> means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufﬁcient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, he at once attains the stage of <em>brahma-nirvāṇa.</em> There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratiﬁcation, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Attainment of Kṛṣṇa consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="para">Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore <em>brāhmī sthiti</em> means “not on the platform of material activities.” Devotional service of the Lord is accepted in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> as the liberated stage (<em>sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate</em>). Therefore, <em>brāhmī sthiti</em> is liberation from material bondage.</div>
